## Metrownome Privacy “Policy”

Metrownome does not collect or save any data.

The only “server” we have is this terrible Google website. Even if we wanted to store any data from our app  (and we definitely don’t) this site is woefully unable to do so.

So feel free to sleep in tomorrow and skip that workout... we’ll never know.
